  <p>[!TIP] If your character is low on mana and has high mana abilitites, it’s recommended to put high mana skills to the top.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!WARNING] Because the bot always attacks and if your mana pool is low, your character might not find the mana to recast things like “Holy Recovery Division”. A fix for this may be to not use too many skills that require high mana like “Healing Cycle” as it will constantly lower your mana because of it’s low cooldown.</p>
